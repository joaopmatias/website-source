Why?
Understand where code misbehaves

What?
Look inside Python calls

How?
Using pdb or PyCharm








I have been using [JEP](https://github.com/ninia/jep) (Java Embeded Python) to allow calling the code written, in Python, by a team of data scientists in some Java microservices for quite a while now. In general, this solution has been very stable and fast.

However, a while back and after some specific changes in the Python code, we started seeing some segfaults occurring when the code that would run smoothly in Python was executed through JEP. Fortunately, the story ends in success and I would like to share my experience while debugging this issue. I hope some of its aspects ressonate with others.

# The issue 

The issue is documented [here](https://github.com/ninia/jep/issues/241). In broad strokes, running some models from the `pmdarima` or `statsmodels` packages was causing a segfault and due to the sudden crash, a traceback was not available.


Both packages, use Scipy and given the complexity of this library, it was possible that it would be simply impossible to use Jep to run that specific code.
